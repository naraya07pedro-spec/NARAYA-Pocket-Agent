# Progress ledger | NARAYA Pocket Agent

Rules: **Implemented** = source exists. **Tested** = observed in named environment. **CI verified** = public run and exact commit SHA. **Live verified** = real Cloudflare/owner device/provider. None imply a later level automatically.

## 2026-11-09 | Stage P0.1 | Safe cloud-monitor backend

**Implemented and merged into `main`:** TypeScript Worker API, D1 migration, conditional scheduler lease/state machine, GitHub public default-branch reader, owner token gate, pause/resume with optimistic version, observation log, GitHub Actions offline test configuration, threat model and operator runbook.

**Local tested:** Node.js 22.16, Node built-in SQLite test double, 10 deterministic tests across authentication/input validation/deduplication/real SQL queries/provider errors/lease fencing/status changes. Source TypeScript typecheck run with `tsc` 5.8.3.

**GitHub Actions verified:** PR head `982f6ad8d331035a73ff5e97c88f9cada697e73a` and merged source `main` commit `d8298143a942d75ad6846fcd1510ea4ea2cde704` both passed offline tests and TypeScript checks. [Main CI run](https://github.com/naraya07pedro-spec/NARAYA-Pocket-Agent/actions/runs/42651566624).

**Unverified:** actual Cloudflare D1/Cron behavior, live GitHub provider read, Android hardware, off-device acceptance, uptime, user adoption, billing impact. Read `docs/EVIDENCE.md` for current class.

**Next evidence gate:** owner-approved real Cloudflare D1 test, then powered-off-phone test. See [issue #2](https://github.com/naraya07pedro-spec/NARAYA-Pocket-Agent/issues/2). No production deploy until explicit authorization.

**Owner choices retained:** Android first; personal + business incrementally; safe actions automatic, sensitive actions approval-gated; zero additional spending.
